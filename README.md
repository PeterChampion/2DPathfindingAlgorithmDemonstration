# 2D Path Finding Algorithm :compass:

This project was started as a means of applying different pathfinding techniques practically to 2D environments, as whenever I would create 2D AI's I would find their simple pathing frustrating at times, with little knowledge on how to improve their navigation around their environments. This project features pathfinding algorithms ranging from A*, Dijkstras, Breath-First Search & Depth-First Search, which all have their own unique approach to reaching their destination.
